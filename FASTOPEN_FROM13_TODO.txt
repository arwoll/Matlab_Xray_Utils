There are some changes of the master branch since fastopen_from13 was created.  Thus I think the proper way to proceed is to first merge the new master into fastopen_from13:

First, on "surprise": I do:

git pull fastopen_from13.
 *or* 
git pull origin fastopen_from13
 *or*
git fetch origin fastopen_from13
 *or* use the github gui...

THEN:

git checkout fastopen_from13
git merge master 

# perform tests, especially with gidview.

git checkout master
git merge fastopen_from13
git commit v1.5  (A new version).

Note: In general what are the various ways I SHOULD indicate versions?
