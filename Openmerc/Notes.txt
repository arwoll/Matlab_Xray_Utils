Working out dead time calc. 
DXP delivers "triggers", "livetime", "realtime", and "output_evts".
I start by presuming that triggers == fastpeaks
Then p. 95 of DXP Mercury manual (Prospect Software version 1.0.x) says:

ICR_m = FASTPEAKS/LIVETIME
OCR = EVTSINRUN/REALTIME

Then to 0th order:

N_true = N_meas * ICR_m/OCR

where ICR_m is used as an apprimation to ICR_t.

For better correction we must know the fast channel dead time,
tau_fast, and then invert:

ICR_m = ICR_t * exp(-ICR_t * tau_fast)
