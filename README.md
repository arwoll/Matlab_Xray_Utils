"Matlab_Xray_Utils" is a collection of matlab tools for manipulating and plotting x-ray data, developed by Arthur Woll (arthurwoll@cornell.edu). The primary use of these utilities is to support synchrotron-based data obtained at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. 

Utilities are divided into descriptive directories. 

Many of the scripts here relate to data obtained using proprietary software, SPEC (Certified Scientific Software, www.certif.com), and require an additional utility, "openspec" which is not part of this distribution. (When available, a link will be provided). 

ToDo for this README: 
* how to obtain a copy -- possibly linking to a read-only version onto Google Drive
* Reference to test scripts and data sets within each subdirectory
* Guidelines for modifying & contributing
